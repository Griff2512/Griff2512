## 👨‍💻 About Me
In November 2024, I experienced a life-changing injury — I fell 16 feet from a ladder while putting up Christmas lights, breaking my femur and wrist. During my recovery, I reflected on my career and made the decision to pursue software development, a field I had never imagined entering.  

Since then, I’ve discovered a passion for **front-end development** — creating clean, responsive, and interactive web experiences. I am actively sharpening my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** through hands-on projects and the **CourseCareers Software Development Program**. My goal is to grow into a professional front-end developer who builds intuitive and impactful user experiences.
